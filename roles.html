<h2>PLDI Student Volunteer Roles</h2>

Here is a complete list of student volunteer duties, by role.  Note that you may be called on to do other things at the spur of the moment, so this should only serve as a rough guide.

In general, your scheduled volunteer timeslot starts 15 minutes or more before the start of the event you need to work.  If you happen to notice that this is not the case, I made a mistake, so please be sure to arrive early!

<h3>Bag Stuffer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare bags for attendees.  Basically, putting flyers, schedules, and conference goodies into tote bags / folders to be handed out to conference attendees who come to the registration desk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registrar / Info Desk</h3>

<ul>
  <li>People will come to you to pick up their badges.</li>
  <li>Find and give them their name tag.</li>
  <li>Give them a conference bag prepared by the bag stuffers.</li>
  <li>If their name tag is missing, if they have not completed registration (pink slip), or they have not registered, refer them to Carol, who will take care of this.</li>
  <li>Familiarize yourself with the conference schedule and the locations of events and be prepared to direct people to the appropriate location.</li>
</ul>

<h3>WS (workshop) Assistant</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure to arrive before the start of the session.</li>
  <li>Introduce yourself to the workshop session chair.  Let him/her know that you are the SV assigned to help out and that you are there to help them solve problems.</li>
  <li><b>IMPORTANT</b>: make sure that the projector is present, set up, and turned on.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the workshop session chair has all of the adapters that they need for presenters. If not, please see Dan, Michael, or Annabel at the registration desk.  We can acquire adapters for you.</li>
  <li>Likewise, if there are room temperature issues, see Dan, Michael, or Annabel.</li>
  <li><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Wait 15 minutes after the start of the session for the back-and-forth to settle down and then count the number of attendees.</li>
  <li>If there is a microphone for the audience (check with the chair), make sure that you know how to use it and that it works.</li>
  <li>Hang around the room in case there are issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Floating Tutorial Assistant</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The responsibilities are the same as the WS Assistant, except:</li>
  <li>You will need to cover several rooms.</li>
  <li>There probably is not an audience microphone, since tutorials are smaller.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lunch Duty</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Confer with the other SV who is assigned to your slot because there are two main roles.  You may decide which of you does which role.</li>
  <li>Role #1: Ensure that only people with conference badges are attending the lunch.  If they do not have a badge, politely ask them to please go get their badge and return.</li>
  <li>Role #2: Lunch is buffet-style.  Anyone who has a special request for vegetarian / vegan / gluten-free / etc meals will have a dot on their badge.  Green = vegan / vegetarian.  Red = gluten free / other.  A small number of these special meals will be available at the buffet.  Please station yourself near the table and check badges to ensure that only people who requested special meals take this food.  If you see a person with no dot on their badge heading toward one of these special meals, politely direct them toward the other food. If they say that they forgot to request a special meal, that's fine (no need to fight about it), but be sure that they understand that there is a limited amount of special request food.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Video Recording</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for capturing the audio and video (including video of the presenter and of the slides) during the technical sessions / keynotes.</li>
  <li>Please attend a training session with Bader Albassam (see contacts on main page).</li>
  <li>You should start the recording when the session starts.</li>
  <li>End the recording when the session ends.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the post-production person, David Darais, has access to the video (see Bader for instructions).</li>
</ul>
